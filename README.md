## Description
- This is my first solo project: A desktop application that can be used to maintain a student register.
- Users can create, read, update and delete information of students, courses and the gradings associated.
- This is where I was after studying computer science for only about 0.5 years, so there are opportunities left for improvement.

## Technologies used
- Programming language: Java
- UI development: JavaFX and SceneBuilder
- Database: a mock database is created to memory during initialization (originally used a cloud-based MariaDB database)

## Screenshots
- Please note that I focused on developing a fully functioning desktop application, not a beautiful UI
- I've included a few screen shots for visualisation:

## Configuration / running the app
- If you have Java, Maven and <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a> installed you can run this app easily
- Run from project root by using command: ``mvn clean javafx:run``
- This builds and opens the application
