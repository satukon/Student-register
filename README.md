## Student Register
- This is an on-premises Java program I created when I studied for my Bachelor's in 2023 - 2024
- With this program, user can maintain a register of students, courses and course records by performing CRUD operations against an SQLite database. Records can also be opened in PDF form.

## Goals
- As this was an university project, the main goal was to learn basic application development: to perform CRUD-operations between UI and a database, and to implement business logic to UI elements.
- This does not represent my current skill level any more, but demonstrates basic knowledge of Java programming üôè
